[alejandro.id](https://www.alejandro.id) is the current site I use to show off some projects from my portfolio and to share my actual resume PDF file. I've made it open source, so if you'd like to use this as a basis for your own portfolio, feel free to fork!

# Getting Started

To get started, I suggest you take a look at Github's quickstart guide [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), as it goes into the necessary detail to get this project up and running.

# Overview

Below is an overview of each file within this project:

## Root Directory

`index.html` - The defualt website page. All aspects of the site are brought together within this file.

## Scripts Directory

`main.js` - Includes the main logic behind the dark/light themes, mobile navbar system, and the typewriter style text.

`zenscroll-min.js` - A minified script to ensure that when a user clicks an anchor link on Safari mobile, their screen scrolls smoothly to that location. [Learn more on the zenscroll.js Github](https://github.com/zengabor/zenscroll).

## Styles Directory

`./sections/about.css` - Styling for the 'About Me' section of the site.

`./sections/contact.css` - Styling for the 'Contact Me' section of the site.

`./sections/home.css` - Styling for the 'Home' section of the site.

`./sections/projects.css` - Styling for the 'Projects' section of the site.

`fonts.css` - Making the fonts available within the CSS.

`main.css` - The main CSS file. All other CSS files are imported here, and then this file is used as the singular stylesheet for `index.html`.

`navbar.css` - Styling for the navbar.
