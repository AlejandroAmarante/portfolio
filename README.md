# My Portfolio

My portfolio serves as a showcase for my projects and provides access to my resume in PDF format. The portfolio website is open source, allowing you to fork it and use it as a foundation for your own portfolio.

# Getting Started

To get started, I suggest you take a look at Github's quickstart guide [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), as it goes into the necessary detail to get this project up and running.

# Overview

Below is an overview of each file within this project:

## Root Directory

`index.html` - The defualt website page. All aspects of the site are brought together within this file.

## Scripts Directory

`main.js` - Includes the main logic behind the dark/light themes, mobile navbar system, and the typewriter style text.

`zenscroll-min.js` - A minified script to ensure that when a user clicks an anchor link on Safari mobile, their screen scrolls smoothly to that location. [Learn more on the zenscroll.js Github](https://github.com/zengabor/zenscroll).
